# Task
Extract - The task is to use Python to pull data on all available starships from the API.

Transform - For example: The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship. Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection. Then create a collection and insert the starships into your own collection.

Load - Load the data into MongoDB database.
